# frauddetection
# Overview:
# This script implements an anomaly detection model for identifying fraudulent financial transactions using the Isolation Forest algorithm. It includes feature engineering, handling of class imbalance with SMOTE, hyperparameter tuning, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and explainability via SHAP. The model is designed to run in Google Colab, leveraging synthetic transaction data for demonstration.
#
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com) and create a new notebook.
# 2. Install the SHAP library by running: `!pip install shap` (other dependencies are pre-installed).
# 3. Copy and paste this code into a cell and run it using Shift + Enter.
# 4. Review outputs: classification report, AUC-ROC score, precision-recall curve, confusion matrix, SHAP feature importance, and anomaly visualization.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Python 3.x
# - Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imblearn, shap
# - Note: SHAP requires installation in Colab; others are pre-installed.
#
# Adapting to Your Dataset:
# - To use your own data, upload a CSV file using: `from google.colab import files; uploaded = files.upload(); df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')`.
# - Ensure a timestamp column is in datetime format: `df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])`.
# - Update the `features` list to match your columns (e.g., amount, merchant_category).
# - If fraud labels exist, map them: `df['label'] = df['is_fraud'].map({0: 1, 1: -1})`.
# - Adjust `contamination` in IsolationForest to reflect your dataset’s fraud rate (e.g., 0.01 for 1% fraud).
#
# Notes:
# - The synthetic dataset assumes a 0.5% fraud rate; tune `contamination` for real data.
# - SHAP is limited to 1000 samples for performance; remove the limit for smaller datasets.
# - For large datasets, monitor memory usage in Colab’s free tier.
# - Contact for support or enhancements (e.g., alternative models like DBSCAN).
